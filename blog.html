        <h2>Q1. Local Storage Vs Session Storage ?</h2>
        <p>
          sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
          while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
          cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
          particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
          assigned to that particular tab

          Q2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window
          object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block
          scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements,
          and the like.

        <h2>Q3. How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
          Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first
          event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
          effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event
          Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
